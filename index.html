          Hi there - let’s cross heritage spaces! Kaan (a binaural microphone by
          sound.codes) is currently “listening” to the old Bärenzwinger of Berlin,
          transplanting the acoustics of this former bear pit into ancient
          heritage spaces of Goan history in order to let you experience India's
          past. This is possible through the unique acoustic data that endured
          through time and has been collected and stored in form of “acoustic
          signatures” (or acoustic reverb values). Because every space has its
          unique acoustic properties, due to the combination of its dimensions,
          architectural design and the use of construction materials - with our
          ears we can stroke the boundaries of these spaces and go on a journey
          through time…

A classic example of Portuguese architecture, the fort was built upon the natural terrain of laterite stone which made it even harder to be breached. On the fort stands a four-storey Portuguese lighthouse that was erected in 1864 – it is the oldest of its kind in Asia. The fort has an enormous cistern – also, one of the biggest in Asia at that time with a capacity of over 20,00,000 gallons of water. The fort is divided in two spaces: the upper part functioned as the fort and watering station, while the lower part served as a safe berth for Portuguese ships. Whereas the upper part has a moat, underground water storage chamber, gunpowder room, light house and bastions, it also has a secret escape passage that could be used during war or emergency events."

Apart from housing a large water tank, the fort has a well and two springs from which cold and hot water used to emerge through two different nozzles. This historic fort also consists of ruins which may have once been the quarters of the troops stationed at the fort. It was used as a prison till 1955 after which, it was abandoned. Inside the fort lies the church of Santo Antonio which is in excellent condition and continues to be visited by devotees."

The basilica houses the mortal remains of Saint Francis Xavier who was a close companion of Saint Ignatius Loyola. The floor of the church is laid out with marble embedded with precious stones. The imposing facade built out of black granite is an exquisite combination of the Doric, Corinthian and composite styles – its simplicity is remarkable. The interior of the church is built in Mosaic-Corinthian style. Part of the building was partially burned down in 1633 and was rebuilt in 1783."

Showcasing Portuguese-Manueline styled architecture style, the exterior is Tuscan, whereas the interior is Corinthian. The main altar is dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, and there are several old paintings on either side of it. On the right is a Chapel of the Cross of Miracles, where according to local legends, a vision of Christ appeared in 1619. The Se Cathedral’s tower houses a large bell known as the “Golden Bell” which derived its name on account of its rich golden colour. It is considered as one of the largest churches in Goa, and one of the finest in the world."

A small laterite mud shrine was built to install the deity in its new location. The mud-shrine was converted into a beautiful temple whose foundation stone was laid in 1730 during the reign of Maratha ruler Shahu Raje of Satara. Constructed in Indo-Portuguese style, the temple was completed in 1738 and was last renovated in 1966."

The tank has a flight of stairs constructed in the essential Hindu bathing ‘ghats’ style. This green rectangular tank holds a mirror to the small mosque which stands elegantly facing it, both built with laterite stone masonry.
